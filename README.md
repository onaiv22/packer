# JS Identity Packer 

Packer code to support the creation of AWS Machine Images for JS Identity service.

Our Packer builds currently create two image types; Ubuntu 18.04 and Centos 7

A Makefile exists to help with the build process, run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile to get a list of operations.

Full details of how the build works may be found at https://sainsburys-confluence.valiantys.net/display/ID/Identity+Packer+Code+Overview
